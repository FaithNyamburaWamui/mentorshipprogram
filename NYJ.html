            <h1>Born a Crime</h1>
            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p>In this chapter, we get to know the childhood of Trevah Noah and his mother who had a relationship with a<br> white man and it was illegal in their country for a black to have a child with a white man. His mother Patricia <br>was a firm believer and used to attend three churches which are the white church, the black church, and the <br>mixed church. Trevor used to enjoy going to church but hated the long journey that they had to go through <br>for them to get to church.  When he was heading home with his mother from church they were forced to <br>enter a minibus and they had no choice but to get in. The driver refused to drop them off so they had to <br>jump off the bus and they got hurt in the process. Trevor still could joke with his mother despite the situation.

            <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
            <p>Trevor grew up during Apartheid, with a white father and a black mother when this was considered a crime<br> at the time. Patricia the mother of Trevor ran from home to go to Johannesburg and had a Swiss man as her <br>friend who helped her when she was in the city. Trevor's existence was against the law and his mother used <br>to evade questions concerning her son's light skin. When Trevor visited his grandmother in Soweto he was<br> not allowed outside the compound because he was at risk of being taken. Many years later he met people who <br>were also of mixed race and had run away from South Africa due to a law that was against them.</p>
